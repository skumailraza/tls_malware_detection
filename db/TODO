+ Issues with RUN_IDs:
  - Currently the script assumes that a RUNS (and subsequently a FILES table) 
    table exists. However, there are projects that we only have the pcaps.
  - Currently the script gets the RUN_ID (or any unique identifier for a 
    specific execution from the pcap file name)

+ Currently if you run the script against a large number of pcaps and 
it crashes it cannot resume. It will restart and put again everything double
in the DB.

+ Improve parsing of Bro logs. We can use libraries that parse Bro logs in a
   smart way.

+ The HTTP Proxy part is untested and most probably won't work.

+ Lack of proper DB indexes to avoid double entries. For example, if you
run twice the same pcap in most tables, duplicate entries will appear.

+ A common case where the script crashes is when it inserts a URL
that does not fit in the column and gets truncated by MySQL. In that case, when
the script looks for the URL_ID it cannot find it and crashes.

+ Bro in the http.log at the MIME-type field does not report the value from
the HTTP protocol but uses it's own way for calculating the file type.
However, sometimes is empty. Add our own field that reports also the value from
the HTTP headers

+ Script performance can be improved significant by making bulk inserts to the
DB.

+ Cleaning function: For some reason in some cases the function clean() is used
while in others the sclean(). Reason unknown.

+ Do not understand why the script uses a pre-defined list of HTTP status code
with their descriptions and does not just get both from Bro logs. Script
crashes anytime if finds an unknown status code

+ Uses too many external commands (e.g., bro-cut)

+ The 'Filestable' section of the configuration file, is it used by any script?
If not it should be removed
